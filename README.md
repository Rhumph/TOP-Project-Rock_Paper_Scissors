# TOP-Project-Rock_Paper_Scissors

This is a project from The Odin Project (TOP) where I will create a console game intially of rock paper scissors where the user will play against the computer. This will intially be a console game that will be further built out with a GUI and other bells and whistles down the track.

For this project I will be using Javascript mostly with HTML and CSS where needed.

I have finished the portion of this project where i just use the console. here's some things it has taught me.

    -The importance of scope when using variables and how to handle that with for loops. This happened with scorecounts

    -Using a return statement is completeloy straight forward, I have to have the if statements in a function otherwise they throw 'illegal Return Statement' errors

    -understanding this type of programming as a series of layers and the rules for things within the layers to interact with each other, so another way of talking about scope really.
