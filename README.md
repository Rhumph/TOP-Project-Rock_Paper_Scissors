# TOP-Project-Rock_Paper_Scissors

This is a project from The Odin Project (TOP) where I will create a console game intially of rock paper scissors where the user will play against the computer. This will intially be a console game that will be further built out with a GUI and other bells and whistles down the track.

For this project I will be using Javascript mostly with HTML and CSS where needed.
